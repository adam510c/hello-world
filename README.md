About me:
I have made a habit of immersing myself into mastering various topics and endeavors over the years. These have included (but are not limited to) rock climbing, beer making, guitar, poker, neuroscience, teaching and now programming. I have dabbled a bit in the past, but am going full bore into learning to code. I have played a bit with HTML and CSS but am currently focusing on Python.
